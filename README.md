# E-Commerce Churn Analysis

## Description

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that focuses on Churn Analysis within the E-Commerce sector. The project aims to predict customer churn using various machine learning algorithms and techniques such as data preprocessing, feature selection, and model optimization.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is educational. I've undertaken this analysis to practice my data science and machine learning skills. The project serves as a valuable addition to my portfolio, demonstrating my capability to handle end-to-end data science projects.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- XGBoost

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Loaded the dataset and performed initial exploration to understand the data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Removed missing or irrelevant information.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Transformed categorical variables into dummy variables.
4. **Feature Selection**: Used Recursive Feature Elimination for feature selection.
5. **Model Training**: Utilized Logistic Regression for the initial model training.
6. **Model Optimization**: Applied GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and used XGBoost for ensemble learning.
7. **Evaluation and Interpretation**: Evaluated the model using various metrics and interpreted the results.
